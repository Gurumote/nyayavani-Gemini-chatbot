LawBot: The Judgifier 🤖⚖️
Welcome, seekers of legal wisdom—and laughter! LawBot is not just another legal chatbot. It's here to answer your law-related quandaries, sprinkle in some honest-to-goodness fun, and keep you on the right side of the law (and sanity).

📢 Features Like No Other
Law Lingo, Minus the Snooze: Clear, simple explanations—no legalese attacks.

Pun Power: Jokes, memes, and law puns for maximum justice (and maximum groans).

Mood Detector: Spot if you’re frustrated (Example: “I NEED A LAWYER!”) and responds with extra empathy, GIFs, or funny lawyer quotes.

“Random Act of Legal Kindness”: Get a random tip to avoid future legal trouble… or to win lawyer trivia at parties.

Legal Haiku Generator: Because who doesn’t want to hear “Power of Attorney, / Winds of change in the courthouse, / Objection sustained”?

Quick Exit Mode: Boss walks in? Instantly switches your screen to “boring spreadsheet” mode (you’re safe!).

🧑⚖️ Example Queries
Q: Can I represent myself in court?
A: You absolutely can—just remember, an attorney who represents himself has a fool for a client, and a very talkative friend (himself)!

Q: What does “habeas corpus” mean?
A: It means “you shall have the body”—not in a zombie way, but more like “bring the person to court!”

Q: Is pineapple on pizza illegal?
A: Debatable. Not in the courts, but definitely in the Court of Public Opinion.

🎉 Quirky Extras
Legal Fortune Cookie: Get a daily oddball legal fact or mild prophecy (e.g., “You will not be called for jury duty this year. Hopefully.”)

Secret Judge Mode: Type “robeup” to get advice with extra authority and random gavel sounds.

Undo Bad Questions: Detects and gently rephrases “Oops, can I actually do that?!” moments.
